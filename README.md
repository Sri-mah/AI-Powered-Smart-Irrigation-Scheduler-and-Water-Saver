🌱 AI-Powered Smart Irrigation Scheduler & Water Saver

💡 Our attempt to make irrigation smarter and water-saving easier

Water wastage in agriculture is a real problem we see around us.
Many farmers still depend on guesswork for irrigation, which often leads to overwatering or crop stress.
So, we built a simple AI-based system that guides irrigation decisions and also motivates users through a gamified experience.

🚜 What problem are we solving?

• Farmers don’t know the right time to irrigate.
• Too much or too little water affects crop yield.
• No system to track or encourage water-saving habits.

💡 Our idea

Instead of just showing moisture values, our system:
• Predicts future soil moisture using AI.
• Suggests whether irrigation is needed or not.
• Rewards users for saving water.
This way, users don’t just see data — they learn and improve over time.

🎮 Gamification in our system

To make the system engaging:
• Users earn Water Credit Scores.
• Badges are awarded for smart irrigation.
• Progress is visualized using simple charts.
This encourages better decisions and consistent water saving.

✨ Features

• AI-based soil moisture prediction.
• Pump ON / OFF recommendation.
• Water saving score and badges.
• Easy-to-use dashboard.

🛠 Technologies Used

• Python & Flask
• Machine Learning
• HTML, CSS
• Chart.js

🌱 Future Improvements

• Connect with real soil moisture sensors.
• Mobile app for farmers.
• Weather-based irrigation suggestions.

🚀 Why this matters in a hackathon

In many hackathons, projects look impressive but don’t always solve real problems.
We chose agriculture because water wastage is something we see around us every day.

This project is our small attempt to help farmers make better irrigation decisions
using AI, instead of guesswork. Even saving a little water every day can make a big
difference in the long run.

For us, this hackathon was not just about building a project,
but about building something meaningful and useful in the real world.
 
*/ If this idea can help save even a small amount of water, we believe the effort is worth it. /*
