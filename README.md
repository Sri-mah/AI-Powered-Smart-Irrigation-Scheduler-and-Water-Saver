🌱 AI-Powered Smart Irrigation Scheduler & Water Saver

💡 Our attempt to make irrigation smarter and water-saving easier

Water wastage in agriculture is a real problem we see around us.
Many farmers still depend on guesswork for irrigation, which often leads to overwatering or crop stress.
So, we built a simple AI-based system that guides irrigation decisions and also motivates users through a gamified experience.

🚜 What problem are we solving?

• Farmers don’t know the right time to irrigate.
• Too much or too little water affects crop yield.
• No system to track or encourage water-saving habits.

💡 Our idea

Instead of just showing moisture values, our system:
• Predicts future soil moisture using AI.
• Suggests whether irrigation is needed or not.
• Rewards users for saving water.
This way, users don’t just see data — they learn and improve over time.

🎮 Gamification in our system

To make the system engaging:
• Users earn Water Credit Scores.
• Badges are awarded for smart irrigation.
• Progress is visualized using simple charts.
This encourages better decisions and consistent water saving.

✨ Features

• AI-based soil moisture prediction.
• Pump ON / OFF recommendation.
• Water saving score and badges.
• Easy-to-use dashboard.

🛠 Technologies Used

• Python & Flask
• Machine Learning
• HTML, CSS
• Chart.js

🌱 Future Improvements

• Connect with real soil moisture sensors.
• Mobile app for farmers.
• Weather-based irrigation suggestions.

🏆 Hackathon Relevance

This project shows how AI can be applied practically in agriculture.
By combining intelligence with gamification, we aim to promote sustainable farming in a simple and effective way.
